        HTML5 Features
    </h1>
<p class="content"> No matter what you use as your browser, it could be Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. One purpose they all have is to render your files such as your HTML, CSS, or your JavaScript files into a website that is to be displayed.
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. There are many markup languages such as XML, GML, etc. All these languages are called markup languages because they‚Äôre based on the concept of markups that are used by editors when they mark up the manuscripts to either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers. For example, underlining a word represents it should be printed in italics.
    HTML5 is one of the latest web technologies that are mostly being used in the web industry.</p>

<p><b>Local Storage: </b>The HTML5 has local Storage which means that the object stores the data with no expiration date and so your work will be available to you even after you refresh or close your browser. This feature depends on your browser. It will work on Chrome 4.0, Internet Explorer/Edge 8.0, Firefox 3.5, Safari 4.0, and Opera 11.5 or their later versions.</p>
<p><b>Doctype: </b>In HTML5, you get a new doctype which helps you stay up to date! doctype is the first necessity in an HTML5 document, so in HTML5 doctype is written as <!doctype html>. HTML5 is
    SGML based unlike HTML4.01 or XHTML1. If you don‚Äôt use doctype at the beginning of your HTML5 file your page will not load up like the structure you wanted.</p>
<p><b>Required Attribute: </b>With HTML5, forms now have a new required attribute that can automatically check whether a specific input field is needed or not. This saves us the effort to write the code for validation of the form.</p>
<p><b>Multimedia Support: </b>Multimedia can be of many different formats like images, music, videos, records, animations, and more. Through HTML5‚Äôs new APIs, you can easily control, access, and manipulate the network and timeline states of these files. If you want to add a video or audio to your site it‚Äôs all possible with HTML5.</p>
<p><b>Canvas: </b>We can use this to draw graphics on the website in HTML5. Canvas has four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text. The HTML canvas element is employed to draw graphics, via JavaScript. Canvas allows you to create circles, lines, boxes furthermore as other graphics.</p>
